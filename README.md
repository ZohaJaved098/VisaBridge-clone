# Interactive Animated Website (Practice Duplicate)

This project is a **practice duplicate** of an existing website, developed to explore animations and responsiveness using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. The main focus was to replicate the visual style with custom animations and make the design responsive. This was created during 6 weeks Internship at Qwerty Experts.

### Features
- **Animations**: Includes custom animations to enhance the user experience and engagement, achieved using Tailwind CSS.
- **Responsiveness**: The homepage is responsive, adapting to different screen sizes for a smooth mobile and desktop experience.
- **Single Page**: Only the homepage has been developed, and while it is interactive and visually complete, **it is not functional** (non-clickable buttons, links, etc.).
- **Non-functional Navigation**: Other pages have not been developed, and links to them are placeholders.

**Note**: This project is intended for practice purposes only and is a duplicate of an existing website design.
